# Capstone-Project-3--Launching-an-Amazon-EC2-Instance-Using-AWS-CloudFormation

AWS Administration



**Problem Statement:**

Provisioning and configuring Amazon EC2 instances manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project addresses the challenge of automating the process of launching an Amazon EC2 instance using AWS CloudFormation. The specific problem is the need to create a CloudFormation template that defines the EC2 instance's characteristics, such as the instance type, security groups, key pairs, and any additional resources required. By automating this process, organizations can ensure consistency, reduce manual errors, and simplify the provisioning of EC2 instances.

**Objectives:**

- Create a CloudFormation template to define an Amazon EC2 instance.
- Automate the provisioning of an EC2 instance with the specified configuration.
- Implement best practices for security and resource management in the CloudFormation template.
- Document the provisioning process and the CloudFormation template.

**Your focus in this project should be on the following:**

- AWS CloudFormation concepts and templates.
- EC2 instance configurations and specifications.
- Security groups, IAM roles, and key pairs.
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for CloudFormation permissions.

**Deliverables**

- A CloudFormation template for launching an EC2 instance.
- Successfully launched EC2 instance provisioned using the template.
- Documentation of the provisioning process and CloudFormation template.
- Testing and verification report.

**Tasks/Activities List**

- Research AWS CloudFormation and its capabilities.
- Plan the CloudFormation template for the EC2 instance, considering instance type, security, and key pairs.
- Create the CloudFormation template, defining the EC2 instance resource.
- Specify security groups, IAM roles, and key pairs within the template.
- Launch the EC2 instance using the CloudFormation template.
- Test the EC2 instance to ensure it's configured as expected.
- Optimize the template for performance and cost-efficiency.
- Document the provisioning process and the CloudFormation template.

**Success Metrics**

- A CloudFormation template successfully creating an EC2 instance.
- EC2 instance launched with the specified configuration.
- Security best practices implemented in the template.
- Documentation provides clear instructions for the provisioning process.Â 

**Bonus Points**

- Implement parameterization in the CloudFormation template for flexibility.
- Explore AWS Systems Manager for EC2 instance management.
- Integrate CloudFormation with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring.
- Implement advanced IAM policies for CloudFormation permissions.

**Submission Process**

- The learner should showcase their completion of the project by providing documentation of each deliverable, a live demonstration of the EC2 instance created by the CloudFormation template, and a report summarizing the project's success and any potential optimizations made. The presentation should include an overview of the challenges faced and how they were overcome during the CloudFormation template creation and EC2 instance provisioning.
